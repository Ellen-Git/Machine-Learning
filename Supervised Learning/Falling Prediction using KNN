Introduction
Fall prediction systems typically estimate real-time or future fall risk. These systems are helpful in preventing and reducing  fall risks. 
In real-time fall risk prediction, data are collected from sensors, and are analyzed to compute the appropriate feature set. 
Use the data sent from Gyroscope sensor and Accelerometer sensor to categorize the motion.
